  "about1":"The world needs more mentors and kind people willing to help others based on the goodness of their hearts.",
  "about2":"There is a growing divide between the college educated and the population that may not be able to afford or want to go colleges, universities, or trade school, etc. The difference to changing one’s life for the better, in our opinion, is small so long as people are afforded the right guidance and mentoring.",
  "about3":"PRIM wants to bridge this divide by offering our Global Virtual Mentoring Platform to improve people’s lives. The platform is absolutely free of charge for anyone who wants to use it and learn from others who have been there and done that.",
  "about4":"We also know that time and patience to help others is often limited to help those closest and dearest to each other. That is why we created Primcoin to help incentive those willing to help others. If they don’t feel the need to receive a reward through our Primcoin, they can easily donate to others or charities.",

  "faq_ans1":"<p>Invented in 2008 and launched a year later, Bitcoin was designed to serve as a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash.</p><p>Centralized banks and financial institutions have failed the world and caused the world’s crisis with their endless money-printing. This prompted Satoshi Nakamoto to roll out an alternative means of payment that would not depend on any centralized system with a unique approach to using computer code we’ve come to know as the ‘bitcoin protocol’.</p><p>Later in 2013, Vitalik Buterin had a genius idea of ‘smart contracts’ running on top of the blockchain and making it possible to execute transactions without human involvement. The new blockchain platform Ethereum that launched 2 years later has become a foundation to the decentralized economy.</p><p>Finally, when the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) rally made Ethereum almost crash under the weight of the overwhelming demand in 2017, it resulted in the creation of many new startups with the key purpose to resolve the most painful scalability problem. The lack of a unified environment resulted in what we have now: dozens of different blockchains and no simple way to transfer value between them.</p>",
  "faq_ans2":"<p>Uniswap is a protocol on Ethereum for swapping ERC20 tokens. Unlike most exchanges, which are designed to take fees, Uniswap is designed to function as a public good—a tool for the community to trade tokens without platform fees or middlemen.</p><p>Also, unlike most exchanges, which match buyers and sellers to determine prices and execute trades, Uniswap uses a simple math equation and pools of tokens and ETH to do the same job.</p>",
  "faq_ans3":"<p>The Uniswap Protocol is an open-source protocol for providing liquidity and trading ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. It eliminates trusted intermediaries and unnecessary forms of rent extraction, allowing for safe, accessible, and efficient exchange activity. The protocol is non-upgradable and designed to be censorship resistant.</p><p>The Uniswap Protocol and the Uniswap Interface were developed by Uniswap Labs.</p>",
  "faq_ans4":"<p>To create a new liquidity pool, provide liquidity, swap tokens, or vote on governance proposals, head over to the Uniswap Interface and connect a Web3 wallet. Remember, each transaction on Ethereum costs Ether (ETH). For a more detailed walkthrough, check out our Help Guides.</p><p>If you’re a developer interested in building on top of the Uniswap Protocol, please refer to our extensive docs.</p>",
  "faq_ans5":"<p>Uniswap is an automated market maker. In practical terms, it is a collection of smart contracts that define a standard way to create liquidity pools, provide liquidity, and swap assets.</p><p>Each liquidity pool contains two assets. The pools keep track of aggregate liquidity reserves and the pre-defined pricing strategies set by liquidity providers. Reserves and prices are updated automatically every time someone trades. There is no central order book, no third-party custody, and no private order matching engine.</p><p>Because reserves are automatically rebalanced after each trade, a Uniswap pool can always be used to buy or sell a token — unlike traditional exchanges, traders do not need to match with individual counterparties to complete a trade</p>",
  "faq_ans6":"<p>Primcoin is currently being traded or swapped on Uniswap as explained in this FAQ via Ethereum as the primary exchange.</p><p>Below is a step-by-step guide on how to swap your Primcoin:</p><ul class='faq_ul'><li>Connect your Coinbase, Metamask, or WalletConnect wallet at this PrimSwap Desktop Dapp with your Chrome browser or another browser.</li><li>After connecting your wallet, go to the trade screen on the upper-right side of the Dapp and click on the appropriate swapping parameters.</li><li>Proceed here to perform the swapping of your current Primcoins to other tokens.</li><li>Be sure to adjust your slippage to appropriate percentage to ensure execution, which is highly dependent on how much demand there is to execute the swap.</li><li>Then, you can swap the amount you want, but be sure to have enough Ether for the gas fees.</li></ul><p>For more background information, please refer to the Tokenomics link at this Desktop Dapp.</p>",
  "faq_ans7":"<p>To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of 'Uniswap', some of which may confuse new users.</p><p><span>Uniswap Protocol:</span> A suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p><span>Uniswap Interface:</span> A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Uniswap protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the Uniswap protocol.</p><p><span>Uniswap Governance:</span> A governance system for governing the Uniswap Protocol, enabled by the UNI token.</p><p><span>Uniswap Labs:</span> The company which developed the Uniswap protocol, along with the web interface.</p>",
